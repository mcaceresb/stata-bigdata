How to work efficiently with large datasets
===========================================

In Stata! This is a companion site to my presentation of the same name at the "Empirical Research with Large Datasets" workshop organized by the Banco de Portugal Microdata Research Laboratory (BPLIM). As I was making the slides I kept wanting to go into more detail and examples, so I decided to make this site for anyone interested in delving into the topics I touch upon in my talk in more depth. 

The outline of the site follows my presentation, but I may or may not augment this site over time with additional tips and tricks and ideas for working with big datasets in Stata.
